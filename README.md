## User Profile and Adding a Car

Once you set up your profile by providing your basic personal information, you can add your car using its VIN and registration number. This process needs to be done only once. After that, you can monitor your car's parameters, control its situational behaviors, and stay updated on its location.

## Situational Behaviors

AutoSave allows you to define a list of actions that your car should perform in specific situations. When you encounter an exceptional situation, you can trigger this list using a single button, and your car will execute the defined actions.

## Monitoring Car Parameters

## Technologies

The AutoSave project was written in .NET technology, using C# and WPF. The application was designed in a way that allows for easy integration with the Entity Framework, which is commonly used to connect applications to SQL databases. This means that with minimal effort, the application can be adapted to work with a SQL database, which could potentially improve its performance and scalability.

## Note
Please note that the AutoSave project was created during a 12-hour "HackAGH" hackathon, and its real functions may be limited. It does not communicate directly with the car but instead relies on messages and buttons to interact with the user. Nonetheless, the project represents a proof of concept that demonstrates the potential of mobile applications in enhancing the management of cars and promoting road safety.
